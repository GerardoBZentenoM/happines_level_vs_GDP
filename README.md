# Happiness Report Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the correlations between the Happiness Score of countries and various factors like GDP per capita, Social support, and Perceptions of corruption using data from the 2019 World Happiness Report.

## Visualizations

### Happiness Score vs. GDP per Capita

## Conclusions
- A higher GDP per capita tends to be associated with a higher Happiness Score.
- Strong social support is positively correlated with higher levels of happiness.
- Perceptions of corruption are varied, and the correlation with Happiness Score may be less clear, indicating the complexity of this factor's impact on overall happiness.

## How to Run the Script
